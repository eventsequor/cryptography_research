\textbf{CTR\_DRBG (Counter mode Deterministic Random Bit Generator)} is a standardized method for constructing a deterministic random bit generator (PRNG) using a block cipher operating in counter (CTR) mode. This technique is defined in NIST Special Publication 800-90A, titled \textit{``Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators''}. Essentially, CTR\_DRBG transforms a secure symmetric cipher---such as AES---into a cryptographically strong source of pseudorandom bits. The counter mode ensures that each generated block is unique by systematically incrementing a counter value for each new data request, thus preventing the repetition of output sequences under the same key and seed. This approach is widely used in cryptographic applications requiring high security and reliability in random data generation, such as key generation, initialization vectors, and session tokens.
